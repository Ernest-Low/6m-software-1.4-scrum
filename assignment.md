## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Your answer here
Using Scrum methods, we can improve our productivity in a number of ways. With a small team like ours, we want to stay on track and work with our different expertise. For example, one of us is rather good at handling the servers, another has experience with the MoE tools the teachers require for their work laptops, and so on. Having the daily standup, we can quickly check on each other's daily goals, quickly identify blockers and resolve them, all while working on our own different specialties.

Using scrum also lets us quickly update and reprioritize based on feedback or changed requirements. We also will have a much clearer and manageable scope of the work progress, keeping the team motivated and on track.
```

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
Your answers here
As a librarian, I want to quickly access if a book is currently available, so that I can assist the users with finding their favorite book.
As a librarian, I want to know where a book in the library is located, so that I can return / find the books easily.
As a user, I want a map of the library with each book section labelled, so that I don't get lost in the library trying to find my favorite genre.
As a user, I want to be able to easily check out the books I'm looking to borrow online, so that I don't have to wait in queue to let the librarian check out 1 by 1.
As a librarian, I want a notification if there are books late for returning, so that I can enquire on their status.
As a user, I want to be able to view till when I need to return my books, as I may have borrowed books on different occasions, which leads to differing return dates.
As a user, I want to know when a book is slated to be return to the library, so that I can look to borrow it as soon as it's back.
As a user, I want to be eable to read ebooks online without being physically at the library, as travelling is sometimes an inconvenience.
As a user, I want to be able to request a book be added to the library, as sometimes I can't find the title I'm looking for.
As a librarian, I want the users to be more aware of the rules of the library, instead of having to point to a sign and remind them to be quiet everytime.
